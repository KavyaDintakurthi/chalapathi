	<p>Nature is an important and integral part of mankind. It is one of the greatest blessings for human life; however, nowadays humans fail to recognize it as one. Nature has been an inspiration for numerous poets, writers, artists and more of yesteryears. This remarkable creation inspired them to write poems and stories in the glory of it. They truly valued nature which reflects in their works even today. Essentially, nature is everything we are surrounded by like the water we drink, the air we breathe, the sun we soak in, the birds we hear chirping, the moon we gaze at and more. Above all, it is rich and vibrant and consists of both living and non-living things. Therefore, people of the modern age should also learn something from people of yesteryear and start valuing nature before it gets too late</p>

	<p>A computer is an electronic device that was discovered by Charles Babbage. He is known as the father of computers. There are various parts to a computer. The four major parts of a computer are the mouse, keyboard, monitor and CPU. With computers, we can send and receive messages through emails and save important information. It helps to store and modify data. Nowadays, computers are used in schools, banks, offices, etc., and it is now impossible to survive without computers. In order to run any organisation, institution, or any other office, a computer is a must. Computers have made life easier for people of different age groups.

		Properties of the paragraph Tag
The browser reduces multiple spaces added by users to a single space.
If a user adds multiple lines, the browser compresses them into a single line.
By default, the display of the paragraph element is set to “block,” meaning each new paragraph is placed on a new line. This behavior can be modified using CSS.
